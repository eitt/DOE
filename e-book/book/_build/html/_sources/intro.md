# Visualizing Design of Experiments with ViDoe: An Interactive Approach

Data is the driving force behind critical decision-making; comprehending and effectively utilizing this wealth of information becomes paramount. This e-book covers the foundations of a web app developed by Professor Leonardo H. Talero-Sarmiento, Professor Henry Lamos-Diaz, and Researcher Juan D. Marquez Gonzalez. **ViDoe**, or *Visualizing Design of Experiments*, is an innovative web app that serves as an online tool for understanding the intricacies of data models and statistical testing within the framework of experimental design.

ViDoe's intuitive interface offers users a convenient platform to analyze design experiments results, generate data, and visualize results dynamically, all while unraveling the complexities of statistical concepts. The app's central aim is to provide a user-friendly environment where both beginners and practitioners can explore and comprehend the dynamics of data models and statistical testing without being ensnared by mathematical intricacies. Nevertheless, this web app no covers the whole taxonomy of the design of experiments nor tries to develop a compendium of theorems but illustrates the foundations of the design of experiments to facilitate the data abstraction process.

Accompanying this web app is our comprehensive e-book. It is designed not only as a tutorial for navigating the **ViDoe** platform but also as a handbook elucidating the principles and techniques inherent to the design of experiments and data analysis. This unique resource serves as a theoretical grounding that supplements the practical, hands-on experience provided by the ViDoe web app.

Whether you are a student venturing into the realm of experimental design, a researcher seeking to streamline your experimental processes, or a data enthusiast eager to demystify complex data models, 'Visualizing Design of Experiments with **ViDoe**: An Interactive Approach' combines the theoretical with the practical, transforming data exploration into an accessible and enjoyable journey.

We invite you to embark on this exciting voyage of discovery - immerse yourself in the experiment analysis with the **ViDoe** platform, and unlock the story your data has to tell.
