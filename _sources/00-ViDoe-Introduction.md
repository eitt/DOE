## Introduction and Justification

Understanding the principles behind the design of experiments (DoE) is a fundamental skill in quantitative disciplines, yet it remains difficult for many students—especially when the learning process depends solely on abstract mathematical representations. Research shows that abstract thinking, particularly in mathematics, often creates barriers related to cognitive load, limited exposure to proofs, and challenges in transitioning from computational to conceptual reasoning {cite:p}`Agrawal2016`.

To address these difficulties, ViDoe (*Visualizing Design of Experiments*) was developed as an open-source educational platform that bridges the gap between statistical theory and interactive learning. Built using Python and libraries like Streamlit, Plotly, NumPy, Seaborn, and Statsmodels, ViDoe allows students and instructors to explore experimental design through visualization, data interaction, and code-based experimentation.

The platform was designed with the understanding that **visual representation significantly improves conceptual learning**. Visual aids—such as plots, sliders, and real-time feedback—help learners construct mental models, enhance memory retention, and engage actively with content {cite:p}`Alshatri2019`. These visual supports are particularly valuable when interpreting statistical outputs like p-values or confidence intervals, where students often struggle to grasp implications without context.

Information and communication technologies (ICT) have shown clear benefits in making learning more accessible and engaging. The use of such technologies promotes student-centered models and supports autonomy and critical thinking {cite:p}`CuevaInga2022`, {cite:p}`Dahal2022`. In alignment with these pedagogical shifts, ViDoe integrates a digital handbook—built in Markdown and Jupyter Book format—that guides learners through each module with Python examples and hands-on activities.

While ViDoe is not intended to replace comprehensive theoretical texts like Montgomery’s *Design and Analysis of Experiments*, it serves as a **didactic bridge**. Its goal is to make the abstraction process in DoE more approachable through structured interaction and practical insight. The application was implemented between 2023-Q1 and 2023-Q4 with undergraduate students from Universidad Autónoma de Bucaramanga and Universidad Industrial de Santander, who later incorporated it into final projects and peer-led study sessions. This e-book offers a guided exploration of the ViDoe platform and serves as a stepping stone for further learning in experimental design and applied statistics.
