# Title

Grasping mathematical concepts without visual representations poses a significant challenge for many students. Indeed, research has shown that students frequently struggle with abstract questions, conceptual proofs, and the recall of definitions when tackling comparative problems. Furthermore, in some instances, comprehending mathematical concepts without visual aids is not an impossibility. This study addresses the difficulties students face when wrestling with abstract mathematical concepts and the strategies that can be implemented to surmount these obstacles. It introduces ViDoe (Visualizing Design of Experiments): An Interactive Approach for visualizing the results of design experiments. This web application, developed in Python using Streamlit, statistical models, and Plotly packages, generates interactive components to enrich the learning experience for students. The platform also includes an e-book constructed from classroom notebooks, providing guidelines for understanding the platform and fundamental concepts related to output interpretation, such as plots, equations, and statistics. While mastering mathematical concepts without visual aids is a challenge, it is attainable through effective teaching strategies and the utilization of diverse learning resources. As a free online tool, ViDoe has the potential to enhance teaching and learning experiences globally.
