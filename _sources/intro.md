# Visualizing Design of Experiments with ViDoe: An Interactive Approach

Data is a central asset in decision-making processes, especially when reliability and efficiency are key. Understanding how to design experiments and analyze their results is a practical skill that helps students, researchers, and professionals translate questions into structured insights. This e-book presents the foundations of a web application called **ViDoe**‚Äî*Visualizing Design of Experiments*‚Äîdeveloped by Professors Leonardo H. Talero-Sarmiento, Henry Lamos-D√≠az, and engineer David M√°rquez-Gonz√°lez.

**ViDoe** is a user-friendly web platform created to support the learning and teaching of design of experiments (DoE). Through interactive tools, it allows users to generate datasets, apply experimental designs, and visualize results dynamically. It is intended for those who want to explore core ideas behind statistical modeling and hypothesis testing, without needing advanced knowledge in mathematics or programming.

This e-book does not aim to cover the entire theory or taxonomy of DoE, nor does it provide a detailed compendium of theorems. Instead, it introduces the main principles and structures that support practical experimentation. Its focus is on using **ViDoe** as an applied tool to foster understanding and experimentation. While the theoretical depth required for advanced study is beyond the scope of this material, readers looking for a more rigorous foundation are encouraged to consult **Montgomery‚Äôs ‚ÄúDesign and Analysis of Experiments‚Äù**, a standard reference in the field.

We recognize that this quantitative approach is not commonly emphasized in many undergraduate programs. In fact, it is often sought after by graduate students working on process improvement or experimental design in engineering and related fields. With this in mind, the handbook offers a bridge between basic concepts and interactive practice, helping users gain confidence in structuring and analyzing experiments.

Whether you are just beginning to explore the world of experimental design or looking for a practical companion to complement your theoretical learning, **ViDoe** and this handbook are designed to support your journey in a clear, structured, and hands-on way.
